## Configuring collaborator permissions

Your organization's default permissions will set the baseline, but in order to add users to CODEOWNERS they will still need to be added explicitly to a repository. For example, if your orgaization sets a baseline of `push`/`write` and a user is given `read` as a collabotor or team, they will be given CODEOWNERS access, but will inherit the `write` permission.

>[!NOTE]
>This section can be applied to `repos/<file>.yml` or `suborgs/<file>.yml`. It will most commonly appear in the individual repos though.

### Example collaborator definition

```yaml
# These settings are synced to GitHub by https://github.com/github/safe-settings
collaborators:
  - username: Batman
    permission: maintain
  - username: Superman
    permission: admin
```

## Collaborator API Spec

>[!TIP]
>GitHub's API documentation defines these inputs and types:
>1. [Add a repository collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/collaborators/collaborators?apiVersion=2022-11-28#add-a-repository-collaborator)
>2. [Remove a repository collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/collaborators/collaborators?apiVersion=2022-11-28#remove-a-repository-collaborator)
